Wrangling Hashes, notes and workflow

Hashing?
--------
Hashing is used a lot to generate smaller numeric representations of strings to allow more efficient comparison/lookup.

The fox engine uses different hashing functions for different purposes.

It mostly uses CityHash with seeds.

The main ones so far are
StrCode32 - used in lua, langIds, and in GZ as part of the file name hashing??
PathFileNameCode64 - Used in file name hashing, most commonly seen in output from GzsTool/QarTool. (The name is my(tinmantex) choosing, since I don't know actual the function name)
PathFileNameCode32 - some variant of the above, with a uint32 return to fit in luas number representation, used in a limited fashion in lua. Actual function code not verified.
PathCode64 - another variant, hash of just path and file name, without the extension. Used in GzsTool/QarTool dictionary.
PathCode64Gz - as above, but for GZ.

In most cases we (modders) are only presented with the hashes themselves, and working with just hashes is not ideal in terms of identifying something in a human way so we want to recover the original strings.

Assuming we know/have a running version of the hash function used we do this by gathering the hashes we want to recover, a list of strings we think might be the original values and comparing by converting the string using the same hash function and then comparing to the hash.


Main goals:
-----------
Creating a definitive set of hashes for a given set of data.
Creating a dictionary of original that matches just those hashes.

While there are several dictionary projects for different tools, the processes and workflows haven't been documented so have presented difficulty as different members have contributed over time, some have stopped contributing, and the data sets have increased from patches.

So another preferred goal would be to provide enough information of workflows, tools and input data be repeatable, and hopefully achieve the goals quicker if later research or patches increase the set of data.

Up in the air: Hash lists and dictionaries should probably be limited to the specific game (Tpp/GZ/MGO/Whatever) for performance and to mitigate hash collision.
This is more an issue for StrCode32 (with it's uint32 hash it will cause more collisions that a uint64 output hash), and also where strings aren't likely to overlap with TPP. In the case of archives/filenames it's possible many assets will be brought over from GZ and MGO so it might be better to have combined dictionary? The current dictionary also has PT strings in it which would probably be better to shift to it's own dictionary.

Tools standardization, ideally tools that use hashes should document the hash function used, have an option to output hashes from processed files and allow to specify which string dictionary to use.


Gathering hashes:
-----------------
This will be different for each data type and whatever tools may be being used to view the data.
In some cases we can (barring any additions from patches) get a definitive list of all hashes for the set of data.
If an up to date repository of the hashes can be found this step can be skipped and you can go on to Creating a test dictionary. 

langId hashes:
Repository:
https://github.com/TinManTex/mgsv-lookup-strings

Gathering:
Using this fork of LangTool https://github.com/TinManTex/FoxEngine.TranslationTool/ with the -OutputHashes option will append all hashes of an lng/2 file to langIdHashes.txt in the working folder.
Workflow:
Make sure all lng files are accessible: 
Extract all qar .dats
Extract all fpk/ds.

Delete any existing langIdHashes.txt

Run LangTool on each lng/2 with the -OutputHashes option

Use some process to cull the list to unique hashes and sort. TODO: post uniquify

Qar PathCode64 hashes:
Repository:
The https://github.com/emoose/MGSV-QAR-Dictionary-Project has reference hashes, however they are currently not updated to 1.0.11.0, and there's no information of emooses workflow to create them.

Gathering:
Tpp: Using this fork of GzsTool https://github.com/TinManTex/GzsTool with the -OutputHashes option will output the hashes for the qar file to <filename>_pathHashes.txt

GZ: The fork doesn't support GZ as GzsTools last version that supported GZ is 0.2. So have to fall back to grabbing from the archive metadata .xml files.
Clear GzsTool 0.2 dictionary so it outputs pathcode names.
Run on the GZ .gz0s.
Iterate the .xml files and grab from FilePath= , strip the file extension.
Altenatively iterate the extracted files and grab their filenames without extension.

Mtar PathCode64 hashes:
Repository:
Does not have a dictionary project, hashes are however in https://github.com/TinManTex/mgsv-lookup-strings 

Gathering:
Using this fork of MtarTool https://github.com/TinManTex/MtarTool with the -OutputHashes option will output the hashes for the qar file to <filename>_pathHashes.txt


Creating a test dictionary:
---------------------------
Can either be a kitchen sink approach of whatever strings you can find or generate, or something more targeted from any currently known strings for that set of data. 
This falls into string scraping, and brute-force or dictionary-attack methods.

langIds:
There are many original/unhashed langIds referenced in the lua scripts.

fileNames:
There are file name references in the lua scripts and fox files.

https://github.com/TinManTex/mgsv-lookup-strings project has a collection of strings from scraping various MGSV data and manual additions.

https://github.com/cstBipBop/MGSV-dictionary-generator has some dictionary generation approaches.


Testing hashes vs dictionaries:
-------------------------------
https://github.com/TinManTex/HashWrangler has been created for this purpose.

Input
<hashes.txt> - hashes to test
<strings.txt> - dictionary/strings to test 

Output
<hashes>_matchedHashes.txt - hashes that matched a string
<hashes>_unmatchedHashes.txt - hashes that didn't match any strings

<strings>_matchedStrings.txt - strings that matched a hash, can be considered the validated dictionary for the given input hashes.
<strings>_matchedStrings.txt - strings that didn't match any hash

_matchedHashes and _matchedStrings are output in paired order, so for a given line in one file it will match in the other.


<strings>_HashStringMatches.txt - hash string pairs, useful as a manual human lookup or identifying the file names for files that were extracted prior to the name being found.

<strings>_HashStringsCollisions.txt - hash strings pairs, input strings that resolved to the same input hash.
If you can clearly determine which string is correct then add it to the validated dictionary and remove it from input strings for this set of hashes. If you can't decide which string is correct it's probably better to just remove them all from the input strings for the hash set.
GOTCHA: PathCode64 strings with extension collide with the same string without a collision. PathCode64/GzsTool dictionaries are for paths without extensions.


Ok lets run some data through this.

Setup:
Grab https://github.com/TinManTex/mgsv-lookup-strings
Beyond a collection of scraped strings useful for creating test dictionaries it has hashes and existing dictionaries for tools.

I'll be focusing on langIds for LangTool

LangTool\Hashes\ - has hashes output from tinmantex LangTool fork using the -ExportHashes option.

LangTool\Dictionaries\ - has the current lang dictionary project lang_dictionary

Other scattered output from HashWrangler which will get replaced if you follow the process.

For example I will be testing 
LangTool\Hashes\langIdHashesTpp-1.0.11.0.txt - As of writing the current set of Tpp langId hashes.
LangTool\Dictionaries\MGSV-Lang-Dictionary-Project-2017-08-10 - Which had some strings added that don't apply to langIds as well as some string collisions.

Command line for HashWrangler is
HashWrangler <hashes file path> <strings file path> -HashFunction <hash function type>

LangId uses StrCode32 which is HashWranglers default so we don't really need to add the option -HashFunction StrCode32

Console output:
Using HashFunction StrCode32

As you can see the dictionary did pretty well, matching a lot of strings, but we have a few collisions.
Opening \HashWrangling\LangTool\Dictionaries\MGSV-Lang-Dictionary-Project-2017-08-10\lang_dictionary_HashStringsCollisions.txt shows:

1424049156 cassette_001||option_h_vr
1702400502 mb_sortie_mode_fob||pause_info_point_none
532403241 announce_find_plant||flowstation_sp_seperator_tank

The langId hash, then strings that matched to the hash separated by ||
One string for each hash needs to be chosen for the dictionary, but which is correct?
First we'll run LangTool with our new langIdHashesTpp-1.0.11.0_matchedStrings.txt as this will have removed the colliding strings.
With the tinmantex fork we can specify the dictionary with the -Dictionary <strings path> option.

After that’s completed a find-in-files using a text editor for the hashes with collisions.
The first langId hash 1424049156 fortunately finds itself sandwiched between other found langIds

<Entry LangId="cassette_002" Color="1" Value="TRACK" />
<Entry Key="1424049156" Color="1" Value="CASSETTE" />
<Entry LangId="gameover_select_return_title" Color="1" Value="RETURN TO TITLE MENU" />

Which suggests cassette_001 is the correct langId and option_h_vr is incorrect
The following hashes are also pretty clear as to the correct langId
<Entry LangId="mb_sortie_mode_sideops" Color="1" Value="SIDE OPS" />
<Entry Key="1702400502" Color="1" Value="FOB MISSIONS" />
<Entry LangId="mb_fob_staff_res" Color="1" Value="Assigned Staff/%sPlaced Containers" />

<Entry LangId="announce_find_processed_res" Color="5" Value="Processed Material Spotted [%s] x %d" />
<Entry Key="532403241" Color="5" Value="Medicinal Plant Spotted [%s] x %d" />
<Entry LangId="announce_extract_keyitem" Color="5" Value="Key Item [%s]" />

For extra confirmation a search of the collision strings in the lua files could be done:
announce_find_plant appears, and in relation to langId usage, flowstation_sp_seperator_tank does not appear in the lua files.
The other colliding strings do not appear, so no confirmation either way for those.

Now to finalize a validated dictionary for LangTool
I copy off lang_dictionary_matchedStrings.txt to \HashWrangling\LangTool\Dictionaries\lang_dictionary.txt, since I aim for langtools default dictionary to be targeted to tpp.
And manually copy the correct strings - cassette_001, mb_sortie_mode_fob, announce_find_plant to it.

Another run of HashWrangler, this time with lang_dictionary_validate gives:

Using HashFunction StrCode32
ReadDictionary D:\Projects\MGS\HashWrangling\LangTool\Dictionaries\lang_dictionary.txt
ReadInputHashes D:\Projects\MGS\HashWrangling\LangTool\Hashes\langIdHashesTpp-1.0.11.0.txt

All done

Great, 0 collisions, 0 unmatched strings, we still have 5413 unmatched hashes to find, but that's for future attempts.

For now I copy off lang_dictionary_validate_matchedStrings.txt (as this will have sorted the three resolved collision strings I added) to lang_dictionary.txt to act as the default dictionary for LangTool.

Future runs can be done by pointing the HashWranglers dictionary arg to a folder instead of a specific file, and copying the current validated dictionary there along with dictionaries of new strings to test.

GzsTool workflow:

Hashes update:
GzsTool -OutputHashes for current version qar archives GameData\MGS\hashgrab\tpp_pc_<version>
RoboCopy to mgsv-lookup-strings\GzsTool\Hashes\tpp_pc_<version>
Uniquify Hashes\tpp_pc_<version> - Merges and sorts to one file.
Copy tpp_pc_<version>_combined to Hashes\PathCode64
Uniquify-Combine Hashes PathCode64 - merges all PathCode64 hashes to one
Uniquify-Combine Hashes PathCode64Gz  (even though it's just one file, for )
Note: Dont ever want to merge PathCode64 and PathCode64Gz hashes since they are created from different hashing functions.

Dict tests:
HashWrangle -HashFunction PathCode64 with whatever dicts/new strings you got to test.
Rename output if you're going to use the same dictionary again

Repeat with PathCode64Gz

Merge both PathCode64_matchedStrings / Gz_matched
This is release dictionary.

Stats:
Run HashWrangler on each file in Hashes\tpp_pc_<version> and collect the stats output.

MtarTool workflow:
Using fork https://github.com/TinManTex/MtarTool which adds -OutputHashes
Workflow much the same as GzsTool

Unresolved Issues/stuff that would be good to do:

GzsTools broke off support for Ground Zeroes at 0.2, ideally it should be brought back to the current version of GzsTool
Dictionary will have to be split, internally at least, if not at file leve, since it uses a different hashing function from TPP.

For GZ there is also the strange case of .6.ftexs, which isn't in the extensions list, and doesn't seem to have an index for, but matches if you give it a dict entry.
by default with /Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp in dict
<Entry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.5.ftexs" />
<Entry Hash="196289966432593" FilePath="b28651b8e151" />
<Entry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.ftex" />
Adding /Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.6.ftexs
<Entry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.5.ftexs" />
<Entry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.6.ftexs" />
<Entry FilePath="/Assets/tpp/effect/vfx_pic/explosion/fx_expanm06_ks_alp_clp.ftex" />

SubpTool should be updated with -OutputHashes option and a dictionary.

MtarTool:
While fork does have -OutputHashes, it outputs all pathhashes in pathcode64 (hash & 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFF), not pathcode64gz. However many hashes get hits with pathcode64gz. I'm probably just don't have an understanding what's happening.

FoxTool fox_dictionary and GzsTool fpk_dictionary might need to be looked into.

HashWrangler:
Better stats output/per file like qar-dictionary-project

LangTool:
Change to output to each file rather than append one? Would allow finer grained stats.
